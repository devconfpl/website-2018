        <h6>The <span class="highlight">Quick</span> Version</h6>
        <p>
          Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
          experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and
          expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
          body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology
          choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in
          any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
          conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and
          other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may
          be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the
          discretion of the conference organisers.
        </p>
        <h6>The <span class="highlight">Less Quick</span> Version</h6>
        <p>
          Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
          identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
          appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices,
          sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
          following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption
          of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and
          unwelcome sexual attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
          sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
          Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
          clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference
          organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
          the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
          or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff
          immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing
          branded clothing and/or badges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
          security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist
           those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the
           conference. We value your attendance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
