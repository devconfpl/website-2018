We evolve towards smaller, faster, shorter. Smaller teams or even micro-teams, flat organizations, no management, even shorter cycles, smaller components. During this inspiring talk Sander discusses Cynefin, how development goes wrong, how to go beyond Scrum, why self-organization is hard, why continuous delivery allows you to stop doing projects."

Once you have solved the identity problem, you will inevitably deal with the question “what is this user allowed to do?”.<br/><br/>It is very tempting to blur the lines between identity, authorization and business logic – but this will lead to problems down the line.

For some of our customers, it has been half a decade since we received a support call and indeed it is a virtual non-happening that anybody has to get out of bed to solve a problem in production. A lot of this results directly from our use of Erlang+OTP, and there are then wider patterns that have arisen across our code-bases and even the manner in which we provide support to our clients. <br/><br/>In this session, we will be using examples from our real-world projects to demonstrate how we build, deploy, and then support hundreds of services and hundreds of thousand of events a year in across both the cloud and our on-premise as well as also covering how our software stack ensures that on a bad day, our services carry on delivering content even when servers are catching fire or somebody has spilled coffee on the datacentre power supply."

                "description": "In fewer than 50 years we have seen massive changes in the classroom. From chalkboards to videotapes, the introduction of computers to interactive whiteboards, and now the implementation of Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. But how much learning value can AR & AI actually offer students beyond the “WOW factor”? Are we just rehashing old teaching methodologies and redressing them up with the latest technology? Or should we be exploiting AR & AI’s potential as a tool rather than just another medium? Additionally, by integrating 21st-century skills and gamification into our design thinking, we can push the potential of educational applications to the limits! Richard Lewington explores these topics and discusses what we should be doing about them."

                "description": "We study all sorts of aspects of programming languages, their ease of use, type system, their level of abstractness, but we feel one aspect is overlooked, how a programming language sounds like when read aloud. Is reading aloud hard? Well, yes. We found that developers cannot pronounce code in a consistent fashion. We had 25 experienced developers read code aloud, and it was a mess, even for simple statements. For example, how to pronounce an assignment statement like x = 5? Is it “x is 5”? Or “set x to 5”? Or “x gets 5”? And what about an equality check? Is it “if x is is 5”? Or “if x is 5”? Or “is x is equal to 5”? What can we learn from reading code aloud? We think programming language designers could learn a lot from hearing their language spoken. For example, if programmers consistently read if x == 5 as “if x is 5”, = or even is might be better keyword. What is the ultimate end game of this idea? We envision programming language designers of the future to prescribe a way that their language sounds, much like languages have style guides. When the sound or ‘phonology’ is defined, it can be practiced, taught and analyzed. This will be useful while learning to program, but could be a valuable tool people that interact with code in an oral way, such as visually and physically disabled programmers, and developers that are doing (remote) pair programming. What will the talk cover? In the talk, we will describe our experiment and what we learned from it, so other interested in exploring how languages sound can start well-prepared and informed."

The presentation focuses on technical and mathematical side of solution and gives very good idea about how to start building serious IoT solutions on Windows platform and how to back these with Azure and Office 365 services to save time and money. Presentation introduces briefly the some problems home brewers face when brewing more complex beers. After stating problems the presentation goes through brief analyzis and then focuses on how to build the solution.

Without bullshit and marketing stuff. We will show you what worked and more importantly what didn’t. Buzzwords (Docker, k8s, serverless, PaaS, DevOps, magic&tricks, Oh my God!, F…K) live fast and die young. In our session, we will tell you why a cloud is like alcohol. When it is rather a cheap wine and when it is the best whiskey in the world. In FinAi we tasted them all and we know how to prevent a hangover."

I recently saw some talks on quantum computing and I’ve been inspired to start researching the field myself. There are now a handful of (known) quantum computers in existence, some of which, such as the “IBM Q Experience” allow you to execute real quantum programs. I’ll give an overview of the state of the art, what the potential of quantum computing is, what its limitations might be and a small dose of speculation on what applications could be suited to to quantum computers and when they might start to be really useful.<br/><br/>I’ve also designed a demonstration of Quantum Computing, using Microsoft’s Q# (not a real quantum computer, it is a simulator designed to run on a traditional digital computer) called “Clementine’s Cat”. I was inspired to make Clementine’s Cat when I described Shrodinger’s Cat to my daughter and she was horified that anybody would do such a thing to their cat. So Clementine’s Cat is a humane modern spin on the traditional quantum thought experiment in which no cats are harmed, either theoretically or in reality."

But have you ever wondered when being in an art gallery if it is possible to recreate famous paintings? Can an algorithm repaint glorious Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci? Would her smile be as intriguing as in original? Algorithm based on natural evolution, that determines which species are strong enough to survive and develop and which are going to extinct, can recreate paintings without any artistic talents.<br/><br/><strong>Delivery Passion</strong> - Jakub Gutkowski<br/>A few years ago, I had an idea. To create a meetup place that instead of delivering talks, will deliver workshops for free to everyone. It does not matter if you are junior, mid or senior or even principal dev. Our goal was to create a platform, where attendees could gain knowledge through workshops delivered by world class presenters or aspiring world class presenters. The ambition was so that both sides could gain. Attendees would learn something new, whereas the presenters would practice and receive live feedback.   Our goal was to deliver one workshop per quarter - this was a huge underestimation! Since the first workshop we boast a 99% attendance turnover, with reservations that are distributed in less than 5 minutes from open registration for workshops in four different cities in Poland.   This talk is about passion, and how one small idea can change into a snowball effect.<br/><br/><strong>Cryptocurrency - The Dark Side</strong> - Piotr Stapp<br/>Do I stick to my core investing values and principles and ignore the cryptocurrency craze? Or, do I succumb to the “dark side” and buy some Litecoin or Bitcoin, hoping that demand keeps rising and prices continue to soar?<br/><br/>Wrong!!! Instead, we should ask if using cryptocurrency is ethical?"

This adherence to best practices seems to fall apart at the front end though. We have separation on the back end, but on the front end this all needs to come together. How do we stop it from turning into a mess of spaghetti code? How do we prevent simple actions from triggering hundreds of web requests?

Dealing with only one piece of code at a time eases our cognitive load. But how do we know where to draw the service boundaries? In complex business domains, it’s often difficult to know where to start. When we get our boundaries wrong, the clocks starts ticking. Before long, we hear ourselves say “it would be easier to re-write it”.<br/><br/>Join Adam for practical advice on discovering the hidden boundaries in your systems. Help tease out the natural separation of concerns in a sample business domain. During 20 years of developing complex systems, Adam has had plenty of time to get things wrong. Learn to avoid the common pitfalls that can lead us down the path to “the big re-write”."

In this talk I present a new model for looking at the emergence of killer technologies. I’ll take you on a whirlwind tour from the earliest history of electronic computing to the present. We’ll see how some factors arise, again and again, to shape machine evolution. I will describe how these forces shaped the recent emergence of mobile computing and virtual reality. Then I will project forward, applying my model to the speculative technologies of today (AR, blockchain, etc). Using this model, we in the tech world can apply our efforts to the true new future, as opposed to the dim, regressive fantasies of sci-fi."

In fast pace organizations are adopting agile, DevOps, continuous delivery and new architectures such as microservices. Often all at once. Although from a perspective of similarities between these paradigms this makes sense, this also requires for increased collaboration between business, development and operations. During this session, Kim van Wilgen, head of software development at the Dutch software development company ANVA, will give practical insights on the process of transformation to continuous delivery, with real-life examples from her experiences. She&#39;ll share the main lessons learned and the mess-ups the preceded them. How can organizations deal with the complexity of simultaneously changing architectures, ways of working, technology, and foremost culture? How can we still deliver software during the transition? How can we deliver continuous delivery?"

What followed was continuous extension through the incorporation of handy features to address problems that are hard to solve with relational algebra. Today, SQL is Turing complete, can process graphs, has semantic understanding of XML and JSON, is able to automatically keep historic versions, can analyze time series using regular expressions and much more.<br/><br/>This session walks through the SQL standards from 1999 to the current version of 2016. It demonstrates some selected features on the basis of common problems and compares the traditional SQL-92 solution to the modern SQL approach. Of course, the presentation also shows how long these features are supported by various databases so that you immediately know whether the shown solutions work in your environment or not.<br/><br/>In this session, developers and software architects of all levels gain a better understanding where SQL is today so that they are able to make more educated decisions. A lot has happened since SQL-92!"

Yet, it also has other great uses in classically object-oriented languages such as C#. Immutability can help make your code cleaner, easier to reason about, and reduce runtime errors. But how can you do that without making it feel like you're fighting against the typically-mutable C# and the entire .NET Framework?<br/><br/>In this session, Spencer will discuss immutability and how you can apply it in your day-to-day as a .NET/C# developer. We'll go over immutable objects, immutable collections, and how you can refactor your code to successfully apply immutability to your exisitng codebase. Spencer will also discuss the implications of introducing immutability to your code, both positive and negative."

User visits or interviews also help to bring non-UX designers in touch with their user base in real world situations. In this talk I will discuss the benefits on contextual research including the surprising insights gained from a cross-functional team visit to a call centre based in Manila. Repeating similar visits across the globe has led to a tectonic shift in how we understand our users and the interdependency on environmental and contextual variables.<br/><br/>Such visits have become a mainstay at Zendesk and typically include a researcher, UX designer, developer, and a product manager. These trips not only allow us to better understand our users but also the environment and context in which they operate. I’ll also cover other research methods which would provide lightweight knowledge about your users.<br/><br/>This talk is relevant to anyone and everyone, but is particularly useful for those with an existing customer/user base and who don’t interact with them much. You’ll be inspired to be in touch with your users more and know how to go about it."
