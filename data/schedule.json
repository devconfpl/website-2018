We evolve towards smaller, faster, shorter. Smaller teams or even micro-teams, flat organizations, no management, even shorter cycles, smaller components. During this inspiring talk Sander discusses Cynefin, how development goes wrong, how to go beyond Scrum, why self-organization is hard, why continuous delivery allows you to stop doing projects."

Once you have solved the identity problem, you will inevitably deal with the question “what is this user allowed to do?”.<br/><br/>It is very tempting to blur the lines between identity, authorization and business logic – but this will lead to problems down the line. As part of our work for PolicyServer (https://policyserver.io) we have developed a reference architecture that brings together OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, tokens and claims in a healthy way that allows for future growth and separation of concerns.

                "description": "For the last several years, I have been working in a very small team, both building and deploying/supporting bespoke products that power upwards of half a million live video events a year, as well as forming the backbone of various television services across the UK. For some of our customers, it has been half a decade since we received a support call and indeed it is a virtual non-happening that anybody has to get out of bed to solve a problem in production. A lot of this results directly from our use of Erlang+OTP, and there are then wider patterns that have arisen across our code-bases and even the manner in which we provide support to our clients. <br/><br/>In this session, we will be using examples from our real-world projects to demonstrate how we build, deploy, and then support hundreds of services and hundreds of thousand of events a year in across both the cloud and our on-premise as well as also covering how our software stack ensures that on a bad day, our services carry on delivering content even when servers are catching fire or somebody has spilled coffee on the datacentre power supply."

                "description": "In fewer than 50 years we have seen massive changes in the classroom. From chalkboards to videotapes, the introduction of computers to interactive whiteboards, and now the implementation of Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. But how much learning value can AR & AI actually offer students beyond the “WOW factor”? Are we just rehashing old teaching methodologies and redressing them up with the latest technology? Or should we be exploiting AR & AI’s potential as a tool rather than just another medium? Additionally, by integrating 21st-century skills and gamification into our design thinking, we can push the potential of educational applications to the limits! Richard Lewington explores these topics and discusses what we should be doing about them."

In this talk I present a new model for looking at the emergence of killer technologies. I’ll take you on a whirlwind tour from the earliest history of electronic computing to the present. We’ll see how some factors arise, again and again, to shape machine evolution. I will describe how these forces shaped the recent emergence of mobile computing and virtual reality. Then I will project forward, applying my model to the speculative technologies of today (AR, blockchain, etc). Using this model, we in the tech world can apply our efforts to the true new future, as opposed to the dim, regressive fantasies of sci-fi."

The presentation focuses on technical and mathematical side of solution and gives very good idea about how to start building serious IoT solutions on Windows platform and how to back these with Azure and Office 365 services to save time and money. Presentation introduces briefly the some problems home brewers face when brewing more complex beers. After stating problems the presentation goes through brief analyzis and then focuses on how to build the solution. Presentation ends with live demo that emulates beer freezing process that is monitored by different apps, programs and web pages."

But to be fair we knew nothing about the cloud. 12 months passed and we have learned a lot, really a lot. And today we would like to share our knowledge and experience. Without bullshit and marketing stuff. We will show you what worked and more importantly what didn’t. Buzzwords (Docker, k8s, serverless, PaaS, DevOps, magic&tricks, Oh my God!, F…K) live fast and die young. In our session, we will tell you why a cloud is like alcohol. When it is rather a cheap wine and when it is the best whiskey in the world. In FinAi we tasted them all and we know how to prevent a hangover."

                "description": "Quantum computing has existed as a theoretical concept for some time. I recently saw some talks on quantum computing and I’ve been inspired to start researching the field myself. There are now a handful of (known) quantum computers in existence, some of which, such as the “IBM Q Experience” allow you to execute real quantum programs. I’ll give an overview of the state of the art, what the potential of quantum computing is, what its limitations might be and a small dose of speculation on what applications could be suited to to quantum computers and when they might start to be really useful.<br/><br/>I’ve also designed a demonstration of Quantum Computing, using Microsoft’s Q# (not a real quantum computer, it is a simulator designed to run on a traditional digital computer) called “Clementine’s Cat”. I was inspired to make Clementine’s Cat when I described Shrodinger’s Cat to my daughter and she was horified that anybody would do such a thing to their cat. So Clementine’s Cat is a humane modern spin on the traditional quantum thought experiment in which no cats are harmed, either theoretically or in reality."
